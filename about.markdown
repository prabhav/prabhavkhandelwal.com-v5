        <h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Prabhav Khandelwal.</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          I'm a Delhi-bred freelance designer making internet things since I knew how to how to tie my own shoelaces. That's not true. My vices include typographic pornography, obscure Indian music, Manchester United and (thinking about) writing.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          I'm currently available for freelance design work across print, screen and web.

        I grew up learning how to design and code websites since high school. Tried my hand at designing and coding as much as I could as a freelancer, and ended up studying HCI and Design at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>. During my time at college, I worked on a variety of design projects understanding the UX-side of design, started a design consultancy on campus and also worked with <a href="https://designforamerica.com/">Design for America</a> to address social issues through the iterative design process.
      </p>
      <p> 
        During the summer of 2017, I was a <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/my-summer-as-a-ux-research-intern-for-accenture-at-google-1ac353119717">UX Research Intern for Accenture, at Google</a>&mdash;I worked on the Localization team to try and adapt Google products to the local contexts they were used in. I also interview artists and designers, and publishing their stories for Mindsparkle Mag.
      </p>
      <p>
        My initial love for designing and coding websites has never left me, and I can usually be found working on some project or another ever since my high school days.
