    <article class="intro ">
        
      The &rsquo;Zine is an online magazine started and run by Meghna Gulati, that seeks to provide a platform for the stories and thoughts of the Indian youth. I was responsible with designing and developing the initial version of the site, back in 2013. Two years after the initial launch, I was contacted again for a redesign.

            Project Objective
        </h3>
        <p>
          My job was mainly to do 3 things: revamping the whole content structure of the magazine, crafting a new visual aesthetic, and coding the whole site with a CMS-backed infrastructure. So yeah, I was pretty much turning the whole magazine over on its head.

          <strong>Siteleaf CMS</strong>:
          From a partially hard-coded codebase, I moved the content and code to a automated content-management system. Instead of involving me in the update process, editors and writers could publish articles themselves easily. The back-end is now based on Jekyll (for increased portability and hosting-ease) and the build system was moved from (the deprecated) liquid-based Mixture to Grunt .
