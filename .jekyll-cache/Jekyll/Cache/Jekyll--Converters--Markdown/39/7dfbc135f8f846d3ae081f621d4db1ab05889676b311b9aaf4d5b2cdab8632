I"„<p><em>November 11, 2019</em></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve made a fair share of websites in my dayâ€”big, small, nice, and a bunch of not-so-nice ones as well. And even though none have been a cakewalk because of my inner conflicts of creativity vs. expectations, <em>this</em> place Iâ€™m right now, has been the hardest to navigate. Making a website for myselfâ€”a person who â€˜makes websites &amp; stuffâ€™â€”is kind of like making my own home, on the web.</p>

<p>Because a personal website means a lot of things to me, I often find myself going through this frustrating cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unbounded excitement</li>
  <li>Overflow of ideas and thoughts</li>
  <li>Raise the bar astronomically high without even putting pencil to paper</li>
  <li>Get overwhelmed by my own notions</li>
  <li>Waste too much time <em>thinking</em>, and not enough <em>doing</em></li>
  <li>Get extremely resentful</li>
  <li>Make something sub-par and carry it around with an embarrassing caveat</li>
  <li>Make fake promises to myself that Iâ€™ll get it â€˜next timeâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hereâ€™s hoping that I can break this cycle.</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s a perfect vicious cycle of taking yourself (and your work) too seriously, so seriously that it ends up being counterproductive.</p>

<p>I think I need to detach myself from it a little bit, both for mine and my workâ€™s sake: jot down some concrete goals; give myself a timeline (be my own client), and just get it fucking done with. Because each day that I put it off, it physically chips away a part of me and my self-esteem.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, even though I have an insanely aspirational list of things I want to do with my site, letâ€™s start with the most important and urgent aspects.</p>

<p>The nice part about a website is that it can be, and it should be, a living and breathing document. I can focus on the most pressing things at hand, and then keep pecking away to make it more complete, and representative of who I am.</p>
