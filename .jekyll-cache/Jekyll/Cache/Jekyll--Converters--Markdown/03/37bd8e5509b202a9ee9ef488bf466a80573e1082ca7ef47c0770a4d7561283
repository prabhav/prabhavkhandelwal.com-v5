        <strong>Garrett DeRossett</strong>
        Garrett has become one of my favorite people on the internet (and that is no small feat) by nature of his sheer honesty, humility and humor.

      Reflections while designing and redesigning this site:
    </p>
    <ul>

      
        <li>
          <a href="/blog/hello-world/">
            <strong>
              hello world;
            </strong>
          </a>
          
            <!-- <p>Iâ€™ve made a fair share of websites in my dayâ€”big, small, nice, and a bunch of not-so-nice ones as well. And even though none have been a cakewalk because of my inner conflicts of creativity vs. expectations, <em>this</em> place Iâ€™m right now, has been the hardest to navigate. Making a website for myselfâ€”a person who â€˜makes websites &amp; stuffâ€™â€”is kind of like making my own home, on the web.</p>

            <!-- <p>As I mentioned in the last post, Iâ€™ll try to make my website an ongoing iterative effort. This should give me room to focus on the urgent things at hand, and keep pecking away at the others as I go.</p>
