I" <p>Iâ€™ve made a fair share of websites in my dayâ€”big, small, nice, and a bunch of not-so-nice ones as well. And even though none have been a cakewalk because of my inner conflicts of creativity vs. expectations, <em>this</em> place Iâ€™m right now, has been the hardest to navigate. Making a website for myselfâ€”a person who â€˜makes websites &amp; stuffâ€™â€”is kind of like making my own home, on the web.</p>
