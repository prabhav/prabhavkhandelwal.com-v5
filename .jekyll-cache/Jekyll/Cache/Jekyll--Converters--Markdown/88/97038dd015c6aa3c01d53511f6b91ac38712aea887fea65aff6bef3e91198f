      Varun Chopra is a Cannes-nominated filmmaker, student and director studying in Loyola Marymount College in sunny Los Angeles, California. His first filmâ€”God on a Leash, is selected to be showcased at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. I was tasked with creating a website for him and his projects.

        <h3>
            Project Objective
        </h3>
        <p>
          The site structure was going to be understandably simple, so I quickly whipped it up and got it approved so we could move forward. Varun was pretty clear from the start that he wanted the first impression of the site to give a subtle indication what it is that he does.

    <h3>
      Direction
    </h3>
    <p>
      Varun agreed with the general aesthetic I was looking to go with, but he still couldnâ€™t see that intuitive message that this was a filmmakerâ€™s website. During one of our conversations, we came up with the idea of playing a short looping video in the backgroundâ€”that would have something to do with filmmaking, or films in general.

    <h3>
      Plan Forward
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thanks to the fact that Varun had access to all the equipment we might need to shoot the video, I had the opportunity to art-direct my own shoot. The general direction of the video was to shoot equipment or scenarios that indicated something "meta-film".
